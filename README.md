## **Understanding the Equalizer**

An equalizer is one of the most powerful tools for shaping your audio. It allows you to boost or cut specific frequency ranges, making instruments or voices more prominent, removing unwanted rumble or adding brightness and clarity. WaveShaper's 10-band parametric equalizer provides precise control over the entire audible spectrum.

### **Frequency Bands Explained**

The equalizer divides the audio spectrum into ten bands, each targeting a specific frequency range. Understanding what each band affects helps you make better mixing decisions:

| Band | Frequency | What It Controls |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Band 1 | `32 Hz` | Sub-bass, the lowest frequencies you feel more than hear. Adds rumble and weight. |
| Band 2 | `64 Hz` | Bass fundamentals. Controls the punch and power of kick drums and bass instruments. |
| Band 3 | `125 Hz` | Upper bass. Adds warmth but can also cause muddiness if boosted too much. |
| Band 4 | `250 Hz` | Low-midrange. Affects the body of vocals and the fullness of guitars. |
| Band 5 | `500 Hz` | Midrange. The core of most instruments and voices. Crucial for clarity. |
| Band 6 | `1 kHz` | Upper-midrange. Affects presence and can make sounds feel closer or farther away. |
| Band 7 | `2 kHz` | Presence range. Boosting here adds bite to guitars and clarity to vocals. |
| Band 8 | `4 kHz` | Brilliance. Enhances consonants in speech and attack in percussion. |
| Band 9 | `8 kHz` | High frequencies. Adds air and sparkle to the overall mix. |
| Band 10 | `16 kHz` | Ultra-high frequencies. Adds shimmer and openness, though less audible on lower-quality systems. |

Each band also features an adjustable **Q-Factor** (ranging from `0.1` to `5.0`) that controls bandwidth. A low Q value affects a wide range of frequencies around the center point, while a high Q value makes surgical, narrow adjustments.

### **Quality Levels**

WaveShaper offers four quality levels that determine how much gain adjustment is available on each band:

- **Standard** (±6 dB): Suitable for subtle corrections and gentle tone shaping without risk of distortion.
- **Enhanced** (±12 dB): The default setting, providing enough headroom for most mixing tasks.
- **Professional** (±18 dB): For significant frequency corrections when audio needs major reshaping.
- **Extreme** (±24 dB): Maximum adjustment range for sound design and creative frequency manipulation.

### **EQ Response Types**

Three response curves are available, each with different characteristics:

- **Smooth Curve:** Gradual transitions between bands for natural-sounding adjustments.
- **Sharp Digital:** Precise, accurate response for surgical corrections.
- **Analog Warmth:** Emulates the gentle rolloff and harmonic character of vintage hardware equalizers.

### **Built-in Presets**

WaveShaper includes 30 professionally-tuned presets to help you get started quickly:

**Genre Presets:** Each genre preset is optimized for the typical frequency balance of that music style.
- Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classical, Hip Hop, Electronic, R&B, Metal, Reggae, Country, Latin, Acoustic, Dance

**Utility Presets:** Designed for specific corrective or enhancement purposes.
- **Flat:** Neutral starting point with no adjustments
- **Bass Boost / Treble Boost:** Quick low or high frequency enhancement
- **Deep Bass:** Extreme sub-bass enhancement for bass-heavy music
- **Vocal:** Emphasizes the presence range for clearer voice
- **Bass Reducer:** Cuts low frequencies for cleaner sound on small speakers
- **Loudness:** Classic loudness curve for low-volume listening
- **Headphones:** Optimized for headphone playback
- **Small Speakers:** Compensates for speakers that lack bass response
- **Live:** Adds presence and energy typical of live performances
- **Powerful:** Aggressive V-shaped curve with boosted bass and treble

### **Custom Presets**

WaveShaper allows you to create and manage your own custom EQ presets:

**Automatic Custom Mode:**
When you select a preset and then manually adjust any equalizer band, the preset selection automatically switches to "Custom". This indicates that your current EQ settings no longer match any saved preset and are your own custom configuration.

**Saving Custom Presets:**
1. Adjust the equalizer bands to your desired settings (on the Equalizer page or by modifying any preset).
2. Navigate to the **Presets** page.
3. Enter a name for your preset in the text field at the top.
4. Click the **Save** button to store your custom preset.

**Managing Custom Presets:**
- Custom presets appear alongside the built-in presets in the dropdown list.
- You can overwrite an existing custom preset by saving with the same name.
- Delete custom presets using the Delete button (built-in presets cannot be deleted).
- Export and import presets to share or backup your configurations.
- Maximum of 50 custom presets can be saved.

### **Preset Modes**

WaveShaper offers three intelligent modes for automatic preset selection, accessible on the Presets page:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Manual** | Full control over preset selection. Choose presets manually from the dropdown menu. Your selection persists until you change it. Ideal when you know exactly which EQ curve you want. |
| **Keyword** | Filename-based detection. WaveShaper analyzes the audio filename for genre keywords (e.g., "rock", "jazz", "vocal", "bass", "podcast") and automatically applies a matching preset when a file is loaded. Fast and lightweight. |
| **Analyze** | Intelligent FFT frequency analysis. When a file is loaded, WaveShaper performs real-time spectral analysis of the audio content and automatically selects the best-matching preset based on the actual sound characteristics. |

**Keyword Mode Keywords:**
Keyword mode recognizes the following words in filenames:
- `vocal`, `voice`, `speech` → **Vocal**
- `rock`, `metal` → **Rock**
- `jazz` → **Jazz**
- `classical`, `orchestra` → **Classical**
- `piano` → **Piano**
- `bass`, `hip`, `rap` → **Hip Hop**
- `podcast`, `interview` → **Podcast**
- `game`, `gaming` → **Gaming**
- `dance`, `club` → **Dance**
- `cinema`, `movie`, `film` → **Cinema**
- And more...

**How Analyze Mode Works:**

Analyze mode uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to understand the frequency content of your audio:

1. **Multi-Point Sampling:** Analyzes the frequency spectrum at multiple positions (10s, 30s, 60s) to get a representative sample of the entire track.
2. **6-Band Energy Analysis:** Calculates energy distribution across six frequency bands:
   - Sub-Bass & Bass (20-120 Hz)
   - Low-Mid / Warmth (120-400 Hz)
   - Mid / Vocals & Instruments (400-2500 Hz)
   - High-Mid / Presence (2500-5000 Hz)
   - Treble / Brilliance (5000-10000 Hz)
   - Presence / Air (10000+ Hz)
3. **Pattern Matching:** Compares the frequency profile against 30 preset characteristics to find the closest match.
4. **Automatic Application:** Applies the best-matching preset and updates the Active Preset display.

**Example Analyze Mode Detections:**
- Heavy sub-bass with warm low-mids → **Deep Bass** (e.g., dubstep, trap music)
- Strong mids with minimal highs → **Classical** or **Piano** (e.g., symphony, piano sonata)
- Full spectrum with presence in all bands → **Cinema** (e.g., movie soundtrack, orchestral score)
- Bass + highs with scooped mids → **Electronic** or **Dance** (e.g., EDM, house music)
- Speech-focused with clear mid-range → **Podcast** or **Spoken Word** (e.g., audiobook, interview)

## **Audio Effects Explained**

Beyond equalization, WaveShaper provides a comprehensive suite of audio effects that can transform your sound from subtle enhancement to dramatic creative manipulation.

### **Reverb and Space**

Reverb simulates the natural reflections of sound in physical spaces. When you clap your hands in a large hall, you hear the sound bounce off walls and decay over time. WaveShaper offers six reverb environments:

- **Room:** Small room ambience, subtle and natural
- **Hall:** Concert hall with longer decay for orchestral depth
- **Cathedral:** Very large space with extended reverb tail
- **Chamber:** Studio recording room simulation
- **Plate:** Classic studio reverb with smooth, dense decay
- **Spring:** Vintage spring reverb character

Each reverb type can be adjusted with **Room Size** (how large the simulated space feels) and **Dampening** (how quickly high frequencies decay).

### **Delay Effects**

Delay creates echoes by repeating the audio signal after a set time interval. WaveShaper provides six delay modes:

- **Simple:** Single repeat for basic echo effects
- **Ping-Pong:** Alternates between left and right speakers for spacious stereo effects
- **Multi-Tap:** Multiple delay times create rhythmic patterns
- **Filtered:** Delay with frequency filtering for darker, more vintage echoes
- **Stereo:** Independent delay times for each channel
- **Reverse:** Reversed delay trails for creative sound design

Delay parameters include **Delay Time** (up to 999ms) and **Feedback** (controls how many times the delay repeats).

### **Time Stretching**

Time stretching allows you to change the tempo of audio without affecting its pitch, or shift pitch without changing tempo. This is essential for tempo matching, creative effects and correcting pitch issues.

**Processing Modes:**
- Standard, High Quality, Best Quality, Low Latency, Maximum Quality

**Algorithms:**
- **PSOLA:** Best for monophonic sources like vocals
- **WSOLA:** Good general-purpose algorithm
- **Phase Vocoder:** Preserves harmonic content well
- **Granular:** Suitable for extreme stretching
- **Harmonic-Percussive:** Separates and processes tonal and rhythmic content differently

**Speed Range:** `0.25x` to `4.0x` playback speed
**Pitch Shift:** `-12` to `+12` semitones (one full octave up or down)

### **Stereo Imaging**

Control the width and position of your stereo field:

- **Mono:** Collapses stereo to center, useful for checking mono compatibility
- **Narrow Stereo:** Reduced width for focused sound
- **Normal Stereo:** Original stereo image
- **Wide Stereo:** Expanded stereo field for bigger, more immersive sound

### **Modulation**

Modulation effects add movement and animation to your audio:

- **No Modulation:** Bypass mode
- **Tremolo:** Volume modulation creates a wavering effect
- **Vibrato:** Pitch modulation adds subtle pitch variation
- **Pan Modulation:** Stereo position moves left and right automatically

### **Creative Effects**

For more experimental sound design:

- **Normal:** No effect applied
- **Reverse:** Plays audio backwards
- **Stutter:** Creates rhythmic chopping effects
- **Gate:** Cuts audio below a threshold for rhythmic silence
- **Bitcrush:** Reduces bit depth for lo-fi, digital distortion character

## **Dynamic Compression Guide**

### **What is Compression**

Dynamic compression is essential for controlling the volume differences in audio. Without compression, quiet parts might be too soft while loud parts distort or overpower the mix. A compressor automatically reduces the volume of signals that exceed a certain threshold, creating a more consistent and professional sound.

Think of compression like an automatic volume control that turns down the loud parts. This allows you to then raise the overall level, making quiet details more audible while preventing peaks from distorting.

### **Compressor Types**

WaveShaper offers three compressor models, each with distinct sonic characteristics:

- **VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier):** Fast, precise and transparent compression. VCA compressors respond quickly to transients and are excellent for maintaining clarity while controlling dynamics. Ideal for drums, full mixes and any material requiring clean, accurate compression.

- **FET (Field Effect Transistor):** Aggressive, punchy compression with harmonic color. FET compressors add subtle distortion and excitement to the signal, making them popular for vocals, bass and drums when you want added character and bite.

- **Opto (Optical):** Smooth, musical compression with natural-sounding gain reduction. Optical compressors have slower response times that gently follow the program material, perfect for vocals, bass and any source where you want compression that remains invisible.

### **Detection Modes**

The detection mode determines how the compressor measures the incoming signal:

- **Peak:** Responds to instantaneous signal peaks, providing fast, transient-catching compression.
- **RMS (Root Mean Square):** Responds to average signal level, creating smoother, more musical compression.
- **Hybrid:** Combines peak and RMS detection for balanced control.

### **Compression Presets**

Six purpose-built presets provide optimized starting points:

| Preset | Threshold | Ratio | Attack | Release | Makeup | Mix | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|
| Vocal | -18 dB | 3.0:1 | 3 ms | 100 ms | 3 dB | 100% | Spoken word, singing |
| Drums | -10 dB | 4.0:1 | 1 ms | 50 ms | 2 dB | 100% | Drum loops, percussion |
| Bass | -15 dB | 3.0:1 | 10 ms | 200 ms | 4 dB | 100% | Bass instruments |
| Master | -12 dB | 2.0:1 | 5 ms | 150 ms | 2 dB | 85% | Full mixes |
| Gentle | -24 dB | 1.5:1 | 10 ms | 300 ms | 1 dB | 70% | Subtle leveling |
| Custom | — | — | — | — | — | — | Your own settings |

**Advanced Features:**
- **Sidechain Filtering:** High-pass filter prevents bass frequencies from triggering excessive compression
- **Multiband:** Compress different frequency ranges independently
- **Auto Makeup Gain:** Automatically compensates for gain reduction
- **Lookahead:** Anticipates peaks for cleaner transient handling

## **Visualization and Monitoring**

### **Spectrum Analyzer**

The real-time spectrum analyzer displays the frequency content of your audio, helping you identify problematic frequencies, verify EQ adjustments and ensure a balanced mix.

**FFT Sizes:** `2048`, `4096`, `8192`, `16384` samples. Larger FFT sizes provide higher frequency resolution but slower response.

**Display Modes:**
- **Linear:** Equal spacing across frequencies
- **Logarithmic:** More resolution in lower frequencies (matches human hearing)
- **Smooth:** Averaged display for easier reading
- **Peak:** Shows maximum values with decay
- **RMS:** Shows average energy levels

### **Activity Dashboard**

The Dashboard tracks your usage patterns and provides an overview of your audio processing activities. View your session history across 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35 day periods to monitor your workflow and productivity.

## **Managing Your Projects**
